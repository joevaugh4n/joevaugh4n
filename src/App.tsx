      <p>
        There isn't much you can do on this website but there is a textbox that
        you can enter a secret into and you can just get it out of your system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confession: I don't know <i>how</i> to make textboxes that save
        responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if I did know I would keep the textbox as it is because I believe
        many people say they find the textbox useful, cathartic, and a form of
        light relief that's hard to get in busy urban life or the modern
        internet. The textbox is free to use and you can use as much or as
        little as you like.
      </p>
      <form className="secretTextbox">
        <input></input>
      </form>
      <p>
        <i>In fact</i> the more that time progresses, the more that the seasons
        change, I have started to come to terms with the fact that more people
        come here for the textbox than for me. This is especially pleasing
        because the textbox occupies so much more of the space, validating my
        design choices, which took a lot of workshopping and iteration to get
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joe Vaughan is grateful to everyone who has been a part of this journey.
      </p>
      <p>He is a person who will live forever and never die.</p>
      <p>
        If you would like to give Joe feedback on the secret textbox here is
        another textbox that you can use. This textbox uses the same mechanism
        as the secret textbox, meaning your suggestions will stay private. Joe
        hopes this gives you the confidence to express your feedback with the
        force and candour that you would expect a textbox like this one to
        receive. It is your textbox. It is a textbox that loves you.
      </p>
      <form className="secretTextbox">
        <input></input>
      </form>
      <p>
        Joe is always open to the idea of creating more textboxes for your use
        and believes in the importance of user-led design. Please let Joe know
        what you think via either of the previous textboxes. You can also write
        him a letter.
